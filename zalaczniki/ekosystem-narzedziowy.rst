Code Quality
============

``PEP8``
--------

:About:
    Python style guide checker. pep8 is a tool to check your Python code
    against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.

    * Plugin architecture: Adding new checks is easy.
    * Parseable output: Jump to error location in your editor.
    * Small: Just one Python file, requires only stdlib. You can use just the
    * pep8.py file for this purpose.
    * Comes with a comprehensive test suite.

:Installation:
    .. code:: console

        $ pip install pep8
        $ pip install --upgrade pep8
        $ pip uninstall pep8

:Usage:
    .. code:: console

        $ pep8 FILENAME.py
        $ pep8 DIRECTORY/
        $ pep8 --statistics -qq DIRECTORY/
        $ pep8 --show-source --show-pep8 FILENAME.py

:Config:
    ``setup.cfg``

    .. code:: ini

        [pep8]
        max-line-length = 939
        ignore = E402,W391

``SonarQube``
-------------

:About:
    SonarQube software (previously called Sonar) is an open source quality management platform, dedicated to continuously analyze and measure technical quality, from project portfolio to method.

``Pylint``
----------

:About:
    Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells (as defined in Martin Fowler’s Refactoring book). Pylint has many rules enabled by default, way too much to silence them all on a minimally sized program. It’s highly configurable and handle pragmas to control it from within your code. Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.

:Install:
    .. code:: console

        $ pip install pylint
        $ pip install --upgrade pylint
        $ pip uninstall pylint

:Usage:
    .. code:: console

        $ pylint DIRECTORY/
        $ pylint FILENAME.py

:More information:
    * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint/


``Pyflakes``
------------

:About:
    A simple program which checks Python source files for errors. Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors. It works by parsing the source file, not importing it, so it is safe to use on modules with side effects. It’s also much faster.

:Install:
    .. code:: console

        $ pip install pyflakes
        $ pip install --upgrade pyflakes
        $ pip uninstall pyflakes

:Usage:
    .. code:: console

        $ pyflakes DIRECTORY/
        $ python -m pyflakes DIRECTORY/

:More information:
    * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes


``Coverage``
------------

:About:
    Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

:Install:
    .. code:: console

        $ pip install coverage
        $ pip install --upgrade coverage
        $ pip uninstall coverage

:Usage:
    .. code:: console

        $ coverage run FILENAME.py
        $ coverage report -m

``unittest``
------------

:Usage:
    .. code:: console

        $ python -m unittest FILENAME.py
