What Is a Neural Network?
=========================
It’s a technique for building a computer program that learns from data. It is based very loosely on how we think the human brain works. First, a collection of software "neurons" are created and connected together, allowing them to send messages to each other. Next, the network is asked to solve a problem, which it attempts to do over and over, each time strengthening the connections that lead to success and diminishing those that lead to failure. For a more detailed introduction to neural networks, `Michael Nielsen’s Neural Networks <http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html>`_ and `Deep Learning <http://www.deeplearningbook.org/>`_ is a good place to start. For a more technical overview, try Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.
