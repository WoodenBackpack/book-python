Naive Bayes
***********

.. math::

    P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D)}

- P(H|D): Probability that the hypothesis is true given the data.
- P(D|H): Probability of the data arising given the hypothesis.
- P(H): Probability that the hypothesis is true, globally.
- P(D): Probability of the data arising, globally.

Parameter Estimation
--------------------

Is the true value equal to X?

Control vs. Treatment comparision
